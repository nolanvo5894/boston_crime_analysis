# boston_crime_analysis
Boston and the surrounding area are divided into 12 police districts. I collected records of crimes at these districts for the period August 2015 - April 2019 from https://data.boston.gov. <br>

I explored and analyzed trends in crime time series at these districts. I also trained an LSTM model to predict the district with the highest number of crimes in the future using backtesting. I also pulled in demographics data for these districts to identify factors that correlate the most with the number of crimes. The analysis could be found inside the notebook *boston_crime_districts_analysis*.
